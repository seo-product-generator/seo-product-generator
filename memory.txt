SEO Best Practices for Product Listings:

    Product Title Optimization:

        Keep the title between 50-70 characters for optimal search engine performance.

        Include the primary product keyword (e.g., product name, size, material) near the beginning.

        Use descriptive adjectives only if they add value (e.g., "UV-resistant," "weatherproof," "modern").

        Avoid overusing generic terms that don’t add SEO value (e.g., "best," "cheap," etc.).

        Ensure the title is clear and specific, focusing on the main product features.

    Example Title:
    “Anna 15cm Resin Planter – UV & Weather-Resistant Flower Pot for Indoors & Outdoors”

    Meta Description Best Practices:

        Keep the meta description between 140-160 characters.

        Include important keywords that describe the product (e.g., material, size, features).

        Focus on engagement: The description should clearly explain the product’s benefit and purpose in a concise, persuasive way.

        Always ensure that the meta description is action-oriented or invites the customer to make a decision (e.g., “Shop Now,” “Order Today”).

    Example Meta Description:
    “Stylish 15cm resin planter—UV & weather-resistant for indoor & outdoor use. Lightweight, durable (0.8 kg). Elevate your décor today!”

    SEO Tags:

        Use 5-10 relevant keywords that describe the product, ensuring they cover common search terms and variations (e.g., “Resin Planter,” “Indoor Pot,” “Outdoor Flower Pot”).

        Focus on both general and specific keywords to capture a wide range of search queries.

        Avoid using overly broad or irrelevant tags (e.g., “cheap” or “best”).

    Example Tags:
    “Resin flower pot,” “15cm planter,” “UV-resistant planter,” “Indoor outdoor planter,” “Decorative resin planter.”

    Long Description Guidelines:

        The long description should focus on the benefits of the product, not just features.

        Use bullet points for easy scanning and readability.

        Include the main keyword in the first sentence or two to improve search visibility.

        Highlight the product’s unique selling points (e.g., UV/weather resistance, lightweight, versatile design).

        Use customer-centric language, focusing on the product’s utility and how it improves the customer’s life or space.

        Always finish with a call to action (e.g., “Shop Now,” “Order Today”).

    Example Long Description:
    “The Anna 15cm Resin Planter combines style and durability, making it a perfect choice for homes, gardens, and offices. Crafted from high-quality resin, this 17 x 17 x 15.5 cm pot is lightweight yet sturdy, offering a modern aesthetic that complements any décor.”

    Additional Tips:

        Always aim for clarity and conciseness. Avoid fluff or redundant phrases.

        Focus on search intent: Understand what users are searching for and tailor the content to meet their needs (e.g., "UV-resistant," "for indoors and outdoors").

        When applicable, consider adding related product suggestions at the end of the long description (e.g., matching saucers, plant accessories).
